These people also are members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC; see below). Defined in [Section 5.2.2](./TungstenFabricCommunityGovernance.rst) of the Community Governance document.
* **Community Committee (CC)**: An elected standing committee of TF composed of 5 people elected out of the Community At Large.

### Other roles

* **Project Technical Lead (PTL)**: The leader and spokesperson for a sub-project of TF. This is an elected postion. The PTL for a project is likely to be on the TSC or the ARB, but this is not a requirement of the position.
* **Voting community member**: In order to vote in TF elections, a person must be in the ATC, TSC-ATC, or ACC, which is to say, they must be recognised as a contributing member of the community.
