Tungsten Fabric Governance Working Group
========================================

The Tungsten Fabric Governance Working Group is one of three committees formed at
the Tungsten Fabric Summit of June 2017. The GWG is tasked with evaluating options
for foundations or other formal structures for structuring the Tungsten Fabric
community in order to allow equal participation from contributors from multiple
companies and to provide for shared maintenance of project infrastructure as
well as marketing efforts to grow both the contributor and user communities.

The GWG is likely a precursor to a Board of Directors or Board of Trustees.
The actual Board structure will depend on the recommendations of the GWG.
